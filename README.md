# 🍽️ Food Ordering Website

This is my mini project — a simple and clean **Food Ordering Website** made using **React.js**. It allows users to explore food items, filter based on preferences, manage their cart, and even leave feedback. I built this project to learn React and improve my frontend development skills.

 What You Can Do

- 🔍 **Browse food items** by category (e.g., North Indian, American, Italian)
- 🥦 **Filter** by:
  - Cooking time
  - Price
  - Rating
- 🛒 **Add to Cart** and view selected items
- 🔐 **Login / Logout** for basic authentication flow
- 💬 **Feedback page** to collect testimonials
- 📞 **Contact page** with images and form
- 🌈 Visually attractive layout with modern CSS styling and smooth transitions
